# Theme Reveal in React Native (Proof of Concept)

![GIF with example](docs/gifs/themeSwitch.gif)

## Description
A simple way to create a reveal effect on switching theme (similar to Telegram) using purely React Native and pre-existing libraries working on both Android and iOS.

## Structure
This example is built on top of a Vanilla React Native project.

The `main` branch holds the final code, while the feature branches contain the steps to achieve this.
 - Theme Context and Provider
 - Reveal Animation


## Run this example
```
 $ git clone https://github.com/TimP4w/react-native-theme-reveal-poc
 $ cd react-native-theme-reveal-poc
 $ yarn install
 $ yarn android
```
